## Directory

```
$> make
```

## Running

run script file is provided.

To see how to use script file, type

```
&> sh run.sh -H
```

To run executable directly, type
```
&> ./lu <problem size> <seed> <number of processor> <print flag [0|1]>
```


If program terminated with no errors, the output is written into terminal.
